Welcome to my repository for hangman!

this project started as a learning tool for Python 3.X. I had to take theoretical knowledge
I obtained from Udemy Python courses and try to create something "usefull". The idea is
to create a fully forking hangman game with GUI using Tkinter. You can read about particual 
versions bellow.

hangman 0.1

 - Rudimentary software. The game is comprised mainly of if/for and while loops.
 - no GUI
 - no use of classes
 - can play with any -> picks a random word from the given list
 - dispalys board (showing already opened letters)
